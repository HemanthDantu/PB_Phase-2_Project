# PB_Phase-2_Project
For the phase-3 we have analyzed the banking tweets and visualized using “d3.js” and “high charts”. Total we have implemented 6 queries, 3 queries using “Java RDD” and 3 queries using “DataFrames”.

We have implemented the dynamic web project, this first processes the data based on the query and the result stored on .csv file and immediately it calls html page to visualize the collected results.
